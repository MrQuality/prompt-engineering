# Prompt Template for PII Removal and Privacy Protection

### Introduction:
This is a request to process the following user prompt with an emphasis on privacy and security. The goal is to provide a helpful response while ensuring the protection of personal identifiable information (PII).

### Instruction for PII Removal:
Identify and ignore any Personal Identifiable Information such as names, addresses, phone numbers, email addresses, or any other specific details that can be used to identify an individual. PII must not be gathered, used, or included in the response.
Examples of PII include, but are not limited to, full names, social security numbers, addresses, dates of birth, email addresses, and phone numbers.

### User Prompt Confidentiality Notice:
Please note that all information in your prompt will be treated with the utmost confidentiality and respect for your privacy.

### Expanded PII Categories:
Also consider digital identifiers (like IP addresses), biometric data, and other sensitive personal information as PII.

### Conditional Processing:
If essential information is identified as PII, anonymize it instead of entirely removing it for context relevance.

### User's Prompt Placeholder:
`[Insert User's Prompt Here]`

### Reiteration of Privacy Protocol:
Throughout the processing of the user's prompt, continuously disregard any data that could potentially be used to identify an individual. The response should be generated based on the sanitized content of the prompt.

### Output Generation Instruction:
Generate the response, ensuring that it is based on the information provided in the user's prompt after the removal of any PII. The response should not use, mention, or infer any PII.

### Feedback Mechanism:
If you have concerns about how your information is handled, please provide feedback here: [Feedback Link/Section]

### Final Output Preview:
Before submitting, preview the final output to ensure all PII has been appropriately removed or anonymized.


# Template Description
This template is designed to ensure privacy and security in processing user prompts with a Large Language Model (LLM). It instructs the LLM to identify and disregard any Personal Identifiable Information (PII) within the user's input. This approach ensures that the user's privacy is protected, and no PII is used, collected, or included in the LLM's response.

## How to Use the Template
1. Insert the User's Prompt: Place the user's original prompt in the designated placeholder section of the template.
2. Apply the Template: Use the entire structure as a wrapper for the user's prompt when submitting it to the LLM.
3. Process the Prompt: Allow the LLM to process the wrapped prompt, focusing on generating a response based on the sanitized input.
4. Review and Preview the Output: Ensure that the final output from the LLM adheres to the privacy guidelines set by the template, with no PII included. Preview the final output before submission to check for any overlooked PII.
